⁉️ What is it about?
This is an app all about staying organized in your boredom. You can keep track of your entertainment on this app. The main features will be movies/shows, games and music 

Movies/Shows 📽️
For this element, you can keep track of whatever movie/show you watched already and include the episode you last stopped at. When clicking on a production, you can view the summary, status (ongoing/completed), where you can watch it (netflix, hulu. disney+, etc.), rate it and (finally) add it to your cinema. Ready for a surprise? Spin the wheel and watch what’s next! And tell the people what’s the best by crowning your top 3 and showing what you’re watching atm. No time rn? Put it in the watch later.

Games 🎮
What’s your favorite game atm? Do you have a to do list for a certain game? Want to know how many games you’ve played so far? You can keep it all logged on this app. Pocket all your games and if you’re paying special attention to a top 3, crown them and make a to do list (if they need it). Play with others by interacting in the chat and rating it. Bored? Mine another diamond!

Music 🎼
Like the other 2 features, you can chart all your favorites in one place. Interact with others through commenting and rating them. Crown your top 3 and share the music you’re listening to rn. Or, look at the trending tunes to listen to. Too lazy? Shuffle the cards for a different melody!

💗 You’re you
Customization is an important part of defining yourself online, so there is a lot you can do with the things you enjoy in your free time ⬆️. Ofc, you do not have to interact with features you don’t spark joy with, so you will be asked a few questions when making your account (idk them yet) to mold them to your time. The account will include typical stuff like your user and picture. After, you can add even more customization with a cover picture and color profile. Follow your friends, and directly message them for their opinion (or not).
